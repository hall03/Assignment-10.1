The class is called "shelter" to reference an animal shelter, and inside there are four different objects.
Two are dogs, two are cats, and each have their own individual breeds; Shiba Inu, Pug, Russian Blue, and Maine Coon.
Each of them are called "a" follwed by a corresponding number.
Shiba Inu is a1, Pug is a2, Russian Blue is a3, and Maine Coon is a4.

I've added two functions, take_home() and see_animals()
take_home() changes the input depending on if the user chooses to take a pet home.
First, it asks if the user if they would like to take a pet home, if the user says yes, it will then ask the user which pet they would like to take home.
By choosing one of the pets to take home, the values of the objects change to "Taken home!" for both species and breed.
see_animals() asks the user which species of animals they would like to see.
If the user responds with "1" the user gets a list of dogs.
If the user responds with "2" the user gets a list of cats.
If the user responds with "3" the user gets a list of both cats and dogs.
If the user responds with anything else, the code prompts up the function again.
